    Having obtained Citadel 2.10 from CUG through SuperComp, and then
having helped upgrade it to Citadel 2.40 using, at various times, a H89
and a Z-100, Citadel-86 for MS-DOS 2.xx was developed in order to ...
um. Well, in any case, the first version of Citadel-86 went up on the
8088 side of a Z-100 in the Fall of '84, using MS-DOS 2.13.

   As the months passed and as the whims hit the translator, Citadel-86
came closer and closer to being functionally identical to Citadel 2.40,
and in January '85 the final downloading stuff was added, thus coming
close 'nuff to Citadel 2.40's main programs for the translator. During
March and April of '85, the utilities of Citadel 2.40 underwent
translation and by mid-April, the last of these utilities had been
translated and at least superficially tested, thus completing the
Citadel translation process (thank ghod).

   Now all that remains is isolating and killing the final few bugs,
some of which the translator is certain are resident in the compiler in
use (otherwise he'd have to admit to having made mistakes, lord
forbid!).

   Oh, and by the way, the name Citadel-86 was the suggestion of a
certain Lord Castleregh, and was selected after a polling process of the
first Citadel-86 system (Test System).

    Ha Ha Ha. Here we are, thinking we only have a few more bugs to hit?
Silly me, I decided to add in the auto-networking stuff on a whim. WHAT
have I created? Whom knows ...
